(** Streams.

    See {{:https://aantron.github.io/luv/networking.html#tcp} {i TCP}} in the
    user guide and {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html} [uv_stream_t]
    {i â€” Stream handle}} in libuv.

    Several types of {{!Luv.Handle.t} handle} have a portion of their interface
    in common, which portion is abstracted out into this module {!Luv.Stream}.

    Concrete streams are:

    - {!Luv.Pipe.t}
    - {!Luv.TCP.t}
    - {!Luv.TTY.t} *)

type 'kind t = [ `Stream of 'kind ] Handle.t
(** Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_stream_t}
    [uv_stream_t]}. *)

val shutdown : _ t -> ((unit, Error.t) result -> unit) -> unit
(** Shuts down the write side of the stream.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_shutdown}
    [uv_shutdown]}. See
    {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shutdown.3p.html}
    [shutdown(3p)]}. *)

val listen :
  ?backlog:int -> _ t -> ((unit, Error.t) result -> unit) -> unit
(** Starts listening for incoming connections.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_listen}
    [uv_listen]}. See {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/listen.3p.html}
    [listen(3p)]}.

    The default value of [?backlog] is [SOMAXCONN]. *)

val accept : server:'kind t -> client:'kind t -> (unit, Error.t) result
(** Accepts an incoming connection.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_accept}
    [uv_accept]}. See {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/accept.3p.html}
    [accept(3p)]}.

    [~client] should be a freshly-initialized stream of the same kind as
    [~server]. In other words, if [~server] is a {!Luv.TCP.t}, [~client] should
    also be a {!Luv.TCP.t}, and should have been obtained from
    {!Luv.TCP.init}. *)

val read_start :
  ?allocate:(int -> Buffer.t) ->
  _ t ->
  ((Buffer.t, Error.t) result -> unit) ->
    unit
(** Calls its callback whenever data is available on the stream.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_read_start}
    [uv_read_start]}. See {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readv.3p.html}
    [readv(3p)]}.

    The end of the stream (typically, when the remote peer closes or shuts down
    the connection) is indicated by [Error `EOF] being passed to the callback.
    Note that this is different from {!Luv.File.read}. Zero-length reads are
    possible, and do not indicate the end of stream. For the purposes of an
    application or a higher-level library, it should be safe for a wrapper to
    drop zero-length reads reported by [Luv.Stream.read_start], and convert
    [Error `EOF] into zero-length reads, to simulate the standard convention.

    [?allocate] is called before each call to the main callback, to create a
    the buffer into which the data will be read. One particular use of it is to
    always read data into the same buffer. The argument passed to [?allocate] is
    a suggested size. It is acceptable to return a buffer of a smaller size. To
    read into an existing buffer, but not at its beginning, use
    {!Luv.Buffer.sub} to create a view into the buffer. The default [?allocate]
    allocates a fresh buffer of the given size every time it is called.

    To read only once, call {!Luv.Stream.read_stop} immediately, in the main
    callback. *)

val read_stop : _ t -> (unit, Error.t) result
(** Stops reading.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_read_stop}
    [uv_read_stop]}. *)

val write :
  _ t -> Buffer.t list -> ((unit, Error.t) result -> int -> unit) -> unit
(** Writes the given buffer to the stream.

    Binds {{:http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/stream.html#c.uv_write} [uv_write]}.
    See {{:http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/writev.3p.html} [writev(3p)]}.

    To write only part of a buffer, use {!Luv.Buffer.sub} to create a view into
    the buffer, and pass the view to this function {!Luv.Stream.write}.

    The second argument passed to the callback is the number of bytes
    written. *)

val write2 :
  [< `Pipe ] t -> Buffer.t list -> send_handle:[< `TCP | `Pipe ] t ->
    ((unit, Error.t) result -> int -> unit) -> unit
(** Like {!Luv.Stream.write}, but allows sending a TCP socket or pipe over the
    stream ([~send_handle]). The stream must be a pipe.

    [uv_write2]}.

    See {!Luv.Pipe.receive_handle}. *)

val try_write : _ t -> Buffer.t list -> (int, Error.t) result
(** Like {!Luv.Stream.write}, but only attempts to perform the write operation
    immediately.

val is_readable : _ t -> bool

val is_writable : _ t -> bool

(** Sets the blocking mode of a stream.
